MangaUpdate version 1.3

This version is for windows user
Just run the MangaUpdate.exe to start 

The main function of this application is to check all the updates of your favorite manga from latest and then it can re direct the browser to the Manga Server 
You can search your favorite manga in search button
You can check your favorite manga in storage button
You can change Manga server in Settings (Currently Manganelo and Mangareader Server is available)

To go back to previous screen just click escape from your keyboard

Note: I add random delay (0.5-1.5seconds) for each manga to be check update, the reason is for the Manga server not be flooded of requests

If you have comments, suggestion or bug report kindly email me at israelquimson49056@yahoo.com

Have fun
